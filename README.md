# Igel-Argern-Game
COMP10050 Assignment 2

The standard game is played by 2-6 players on a board with 6 rows and 9 columns. Each player has four tokens (representing hedgehogs) that he or she must move from the left column to the right column. Tokens sharing a square stack on top of each other. Only the token on the top of a stack may move.

On hturn a player:
1. rolls the dice,
2. optionally moves one of his/her token up or down one row (we call this a "sideways" move, because the token is moved sideways relative to the direction of travel toward the finish line), and
3. chooses one token (either his or another player's) in the row indicated by the dice roll and moves it one space to the right (i.e., "forward").

The winner of the game is the player who can move three of his/her tokens to the last column of the board.
